# Predicting S&P 500 Movements Using Macroeconomic Indicators
This project aims to predict the daily directional movement (up/down) of the S&P 500 index using a range of macroeconomic indicators. By leveraging historical data, feature engineering, and classification algorithms, the goal is to develop a predictive framework that can assist in financial decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Financial markets are influenced by a wide range of macroeconomic variables. Accurately predicting the direction of the S&P 500 can provide valuable insights for traders, investors, and analysts. This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to classify whether the S&P 500 index will move up or down on a given day.

## Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, time-series lag creation, technical indicators like RSI and MACD

## Key Features
Integrated macroeconomic indicators such as crude oil, forex rates, and commodity ratios

Engineered features using lag variables and financial ratios (e.g., Gold/SP500, Oil/DXY)

Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices

## Outcomes
Developed a binary classification model to predict market movement direction

Identified key indicators with the most predictive power for daily trends

Gained insights into the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and market behavior
